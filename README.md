#keyword_extraction

In this notebook I use Python and related libraries to extract keywords from text. 

Why keyword extraction?
    - Keywords represent the topic in short, meaningful words.
    - Keywords are often great for quick reads. 
    - Keyword extraction is one of basic tasks with text processing for NLP.
